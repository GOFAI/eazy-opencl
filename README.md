*Can You see the dawn of lisp-based FPGA ?*

Both [cl-opencl](https://github.com/malkia/cl-opencl) and [cl-opencl-3b](https://github.com/3b/cl-opencl-3b) seems the abondoned projects. I'm trying to supersede it with something better.

## Dependencies
This library is at least tested on implementation listed below:

+ SBCL 1.2.16 on X86-64 Linux 3.13.0-65-generic (author's environment)
